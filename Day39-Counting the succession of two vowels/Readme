==>Todays problem: program that will Count the succession of two vowels in a given line 

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with Strings concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we take input paragraph or line from the user then read a paragraph or a particular line which is provided by the user
2>And in java,there is a function split("character") that takes a character in a string and for every that character,it split the string seperated by ','.
3>Intially count will be 0 and we need to take two characters because to find the two succesion of vowels 
4>Here to check the conditions we will get various vowel combinations approximately 20 different combinations [According to code]
5>If the condition satisfies then we will increment the count value
6>Then we will print that particular vowel condition specifies the two characters And it will also count the number of vowel successions

==>Test Cases:
The element shoud not be Float type,Integer or Double type

==>Sample Input and Output:

Enter a line
Sun rises in the east and sun sets in the west
ea
The no of vowel successions are 1

Enter a line
Work hard success will be yours
ou
The no of vowel successions are 1
