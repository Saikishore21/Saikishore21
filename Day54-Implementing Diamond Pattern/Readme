==>Todays problem: A program To Implement the Diamond "*" 's of height "l" of odd length. If input "l" is even then your program will print Invalid line number!!!!!!  

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with the basic Looping & printing pattern concept.

==>Explanation:
1>Here firstly we need to take Input from the User to enter any number Then we will intialize upper line and Lower line as 0. 
2>Now we should check the condition that (l%2!=0) if the condition is true then we will Assign upper line is equal to (l/2)+1 and ll is equal to (l-ul)
3>Then we will perform the for loop here i starts from 1 to upper line and i will get incremented
4>Inside that again we will perform one more for loop here s starts from 1 to upper line-1 and s wil get Incremented
5>Then we will prin the Empty space to get spaces in between the * symbols
6>Now similarly we will perform one more for loop here j starts from 1 to i and j will get Incremented
7>And we will print the * inside the loop
8>The same above process will follow for Lower Half According to code
9>At Last we will perform one else condition for even number inputs
10>Suppose If the User gives the Even Input then we will print Invalid line number.

==>Test Cases:
1>The Given Should not be float,String,Double Type
2>And Input should not be in negative numbers

==>Sample Input and Output:

<<<====Enter any number:====>>>
