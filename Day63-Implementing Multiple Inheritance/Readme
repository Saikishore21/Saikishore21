==>Todays problem: A program To Implement the Multiple Inheritance in java based on the price of the Harddisk is RS 3500/-.
                  The customer wants to purchase n number of Harddisks.Then write a java program to calculate the total bill 
                  which has to be paid by the customer and display the details.
 
==>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented with Mutiple Inheritance Concept.

==>Some Basic information regarding the concept:
**MULTIPLE INHERITANCE :
1>Multiple inheritance in java is the capability of creating a single class with multiple superclasses.
2>Unlike some other popular object oriented programming languages like C++, java doesn't provide support for multiple inheritance in classes.
3>We can implement multiple inheritance in java through interface concept.
4>In multiple inheritance, One class inherit the properties of two classes at the same time.

==>Explanation:
1>Here I have used Multiple Inheritance concept and in that I have included Interface concept to implement the logic and to get more security for the data.
2>firstly we should create a class Customer and included customer details in it.
3>An interface "Item" and in that we need to include item name and declaration of one method "bill()".
4>Then we should create  one class "Sales" and it inherits Customer class and Item interface at the same time.
5>Then we need to implement the logic of bill() in tha Sales class.
6>That bill() calculates the total bill amount (number of products * price)

==>Test Cases:
1>Here the Customer name should not be int,float,double type
2>And phoneno,number of items should not be string,float or double datatype.

==>Sample Input And Output:

<<<====Enter customer details====>>>
<<<===Enter customer name===>>>
Saikishore
<<<===Enter customer phone number===>>>
89785
<<<===Enter number of products===>>>
2
The Billing Details are
Saikishore 89785 Harddisk 7000.0
