==>Todays problem: program that will sort the names according to alphabetical order.

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with Strings concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we need to take input from the user that to enter the size of array
2>Now we should create the array with the size of n because this code fully according to user choice
3>Then we need to take input from the user that to enter the names in small letters [According to code]
4>Again we should perform a for loop inside the loop we should scan all the array names
5>Now we have used Array.sort method to get all array names in sorted according to alphabetical order
6>Finally after getting the names alphabetical order we are printing the names 

==>Test Cases:
The element shoud not be Float type,Integer or Double type


==>Sample Input & Output:
