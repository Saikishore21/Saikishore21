====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program of Byte Array Input Using Byte Array Output Streams And write Method

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using Byte Array Streams Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

*The ByteArrayOutputStream class of the java.io package can be used to write an array of output data (in bytes).
**It extends the OutputStream abstract class In order to create a byte array output stream, we must import the java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream package first.

==>Use of Write Method:

1>write(int byte) - writes the specified byte to the output stream
2>write(byte[] array) - writes the bytes from the specified array to the output stream
3>write(byte[] arr, int start, int length) - writes the number of bytes equal to length to the output stream from an array starting from the position start
4>writeTo(ByteArrayOutputStream out1) - writes the entire data of the current output stream to the specified output stream


===>Explanation:

1>Firstly we need to create a class then we have created a String data with some words.
2>Now Inside Main method & Try block create the object for ByteArrayOutputStream.
3>Then we need to print the statement that Stream data bytes in the beginning.
4>Now we shoud Apply read method which retrives  from the Output stream.
5>Again we need to print the statement that Stream bytes At the end.
6>Then At Last Exception is caught by catch block and we need perform e.getStackTrace Method.

====>Test Cases:
1>Follow the syntax appropriately 
// Creates a ByteArrayOutputStream with default size
ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

====>Sample Input And Output:

Implementing Byte Array Output Stream
Output stream: This is a line of text inside the string.
