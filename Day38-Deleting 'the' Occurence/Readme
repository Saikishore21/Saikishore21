==>Todays problem: program that will read a line and delete all occurences of the word 'the' in a String.

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with Strings concept

==>Explanation:
1>Here I have first read a paragraph or a line.
2>And in java,there is a function split("character") that takes a character in a string and for every that character,it split the string seperated by ','.
3>Then we need perform the loop that i is equals to 0 - strarr.length and i will be incremented
4>Now we should check the condition that strarr[i].equals to 'the', if the condition is true then we should delete that particular word
5>Then we need to print the remaining words in the given paragraph which is provided by the user.

==>Test Cases:
The element shoud not be Float type,Integer or Double type

==>Sample Input and Output:

Enter a string
the sunrises in the east and sun sets in the west
 sunrises in  east and sun sets in  west
 
 Enter a string
