====>Todays Problem: Implementing The Java Program using Throws Keyword By Using Exception Handling

====>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using java throws keyword Concept.

====>Basic Information Regarding the concept:
1>The Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception. 
2>It gives an information to the programmer that there may occur an exception so it is better for the programmer to provide the exception 
  handling code so that normal flow can be maintained.
3>Exception Handling is mainly used to handle the checked exceptions. 
4>If there occurs any unchecked exception such as NullPointerException, it is programmers fault that he is not performing check up before the code being used.

====>Explanation:
1>The throws keyword indicates what exception type may be thrown by a method.
2>There are many exception types available in Java: ArithmeticException, ClassNotFoundException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, SecurityException, etc.
3>Used to indicate what exception type may be thrown by a method
4>Can declare multiple exceptions

====>Test Cases:
1>There should not be any syntactical errors in the code, follow the syntax appropriately.

***throws is followed by a class
***And used with the method signature


====>Sample Input And Output:

<<<<====exception handled=====>>>>
<<<<====normal flow!!!=====>>>>
