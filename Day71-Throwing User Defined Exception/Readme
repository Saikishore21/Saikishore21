====>Todays Problem: Implementing The Java Program using Throw Keyword Block By Throwing User Defined Exception

====>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using java throw keyword Concept.

====>Basic Information Regarding the concept:
* If you are creating your own Exception that is known as custom exception or user-defined exception. 
** Java custom exceptions are used to customize the exception according to user need.
*** By the help of custom exception, you can have your own exception and message.
**** Business logic exceptions: These are the exceptions related to business logic and workflow. 

====>Explanation:
1>To catch and provide specific treatment to a subset of existing Java exceptions.
2>It is useful for the application users or the developers to understand the exact problem.
3>Firstly the class represents user-defined exception then we are calling the constructor of parent Exception.
4>Then inside the main method we are throwing an object of user defined exception.
5>Later we are printing the message from MyException object. 

=====>Test Cases:
1>There should not be any syntactical errors in the code, follow the syntax appropriately.


====>Sample Input And Output:

<<<<====Caught the exception====>>>>
<<<=====This is user-defined exception====>>
