Todays problem: Program to Implement Hybrid Inheritance in java,Based on take input from the user of Student details like number and name.Then as part of academics,
                take three subjects marks and find total. And also as a part of Sports,take grade and display all the results. 

==>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented with Hybrid Inheritance Concept.

==>Some Basic information regarding the concept:
1>Hybrid Inheritance is the combination of two or more types of Inheritances.
2>Again Hybrid Inheritance is implemented in Java through Interface.
3>class A will be acting as the Parent for class B & class C.And also class B & class C will be acting as Parent for class D.

==>Explanation:
1>Here I have used Java Hybrid Inheritance concept to implement the logic.
2>At first we have to create one class "Student" and it contains two data members of student number and name.
3>Then we need to create another class "Test" and it inherits "Student" and also it contains the marks of three subjects of student.
4>Later create one interface "Sports" and it contains the grade of a student in sports and one method "showGrade()" to display the grade.
5>At last we should create one class "Results" which inherits class "Test" and implements the interface "Sports" and it contains "show()" method to calculate the
total marks and display them.

==>Test Cases:
1>Here the roll number,Marks should not be string,float or double type
2>And Student name should not be int,float or double

==>Sample Input And Output:

<<==Enter the details of a Student==>>
<<==Enter Student Roll Number==>>
2250
<<==Enter student name==>>
saikishore
<<==Enter Student marks of Three Subjects==>>
<<==Enter marks in Maths==>>
90
<<==Enter marks in Computer Science==>>
95
<<==Enter marks in Statistics==>>
92

<<<===The Academic Details of Student are===>>>
-----------------------------------
<<==sno==>> 2250
<<==sname==>> saikishore
<<==Total Marks==>> 277.0
-----------------------------------


<<<===The Sports Grade of a Student are===>>>
---------------------------------
<<==sno==>> 2250
<<==sname==>> saikishore
<<==Grade==>>A
