==>Todays problem: Program to Sort elements in the array which is completely user based Bubble Sort.

==>Solution:

Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple logic using Arrays concept.
   
==>Explanation:
1>First we need enter the array size.
2>Then we need to enter the elements in the array.
3>Here the variable i checks the condition from 0 to 3 index values skips the last value.
4>Then the variable k starts from 0 to index 3
5>Now we had one condition that the compiler checks arr[k] greater than arr[k+1]
6>if the condition is true then it goes inside the for loop
7>And we are considering the temp value to get swapping inn easy way.
8>Now we will get the elements in sorted order.
9>Then we will print that particular array which we will get sorted order of elements in the array.

==>Sample Input:
Enter size of the array
5
Enter elements in the Array :
12
10
5
1
4

==>Output:
elements of sorted order:
1
4
5
10
12
