====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program using to perform single task by multiple threads

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using java Multithreading Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

* Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
** A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. 
*** Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.
**** Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation, etc.

====>Explanation:
1>Multitasking is a process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously.
2>If you have to perform a single task by many threads, have only one run() method.
3>Inside the main method we are creating three objects of multitasking
4>And we are calling with the start method 

===>Test Cases:
1>Threads are independent,so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread

===>Sample Input And Output:

<<==task one==>>
<<==task one==>>
<<==task one==>>
<<==task one==>>
<<==task one==>>
