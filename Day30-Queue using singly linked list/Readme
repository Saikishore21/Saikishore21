==>Todays problem: Program to perform all operations like Enqueue,Dequeue and display using Queue singly linked list

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple Linked list Concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we need to create a node then we need to create the Enqueue operation.
2>Now we need to take input from the user that to "enter the data" then if Front is equal to null then front is equal to new_node and Rear is equal to new_node
3>Otherwise Rear.next is equal to new_node and rear is equal to new_node
4>Later we should create the Dequeue operation inside that temp is equal to front 
5>And we need to check the condition inside the loop that temp is not equal to null Then we should print the temp.data
6>Now temp is equal to temp.next,Now inside the main method take input from the user that press1 to enqueue,press2 to dequeue and press3 to display & Enter your choice
7>Then we need to use the switch case for Enqueue,Dequeue and display operations 
8>Now At last we need to take input from the user that whether Enter 0 to go to main menu and to exit Succesfully.

==>Testcases:
The element shoud not be float type,string or double type

==>Sample Input & Output:
Enter 1 to enqueue:
Enter 2 to dequeue:
Enter 3 to display:
Enter your choice:
