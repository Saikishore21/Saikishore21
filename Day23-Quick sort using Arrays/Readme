==>Todays problem: Program to Sort elements in the array which is completely user based Quick sort.

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple logic using Arrays concept.

==>Explanation:
1>1>First we need enter the array size.
2>Then we need to enter the elements in the array.
3>Now pivot element is considered as last element, Actually pivot element is completely our choice to select any one in the Array
4>Then variable i starts from (start-1)
5>The variable j starts from start(0) to end-1 element.
6>Now it checks the condition that arr[j] is less than pivot
7>If the condition is false then i value will be incremented
8>Then temp value stores arr[i],And arr[i] equals to arr[j]
9>And arr[j] will be equals to temp
10>Then the compiler comes out from the for loop Then i+1 value will be stored in temp
11>And arr[i+1] equals to arr[end],Later arr[end] value will be stored in temp
12>Again we need to check the condition start is less than end
13>If the condition is true then partition p consists arr,start,end
14>Now left sub array consists arr,start,p-1 And right sub array consists of arr,p+1,end
15>Then we need to invoke the elements which is user based 
16>Finally we need to print the elements those are in sorted order.

==>Testcases:
The element shoud not be float type,string or double type

==>Sample Input:
Enter size of the Array:
8
Enter elements in the Array:
25
10
86
75
85
59
63
71

==>Output:
Sorted order:
10
25
59
63
71
75
85
86
