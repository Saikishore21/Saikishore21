==>Todays problem: A program To Implement the Christmas Tree Printing Pattern with [* pattern]

==>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and I have implemented with the basic Looping & printing pattern concept.

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we should create a class then Inside the main method we need to declare height and width
2>According to user's choice we need to declare the size.
3>Now we should perform the for-loop for height,here variable 'a' starts from to height and a will be incremented
4>Similarly for width we will perform same loop then we need to perform another for-loop for space
5>Now we should print statement for empty space in between the '*'
6>To print the * pattern we need to perform the for loop here k starts 1 to greater than equal to i then k will get incremented
7>Now we need to perform print statement for empty space
8>The above conditions will be implement the upper part of christmas tree pattern
9>Now we should perform similar loops to implement the branch of christmas tree printing pattern[According to code]

==>Test Cases:
1>Here the height & width should not be string,float,double type.
2>And we should not assign the height and width of negative numbers

==>Sample Input and Output:
