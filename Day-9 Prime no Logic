*/ java program using jumping statements which is break statement
Program to perform prime number logic between the two different range of numbers which is completely user-based.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Range
{
 public static void main(String args[])
 {
   int n1,n2,i,j;
   System.out.println("Enter any two numbers:");
   Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
   n1=sc.nextInt();
   n2=sc.nextInt();
   for(i=n1;i<=n2;i++)
   {
    for(j=2;j<=i;j++)
    {
      if(i%j==0)
        break;
    }
    if(i==j)
     {
        System.out.print(j+" ");  
    }
   }
   sc.close();  
 }   
}

==>Todays problem:
To perform the primenumbers logic of between two diffferent numbers which is completely user based.

==>Solution:
This problem is very simple Here I have implemented by using the jumping statements (Break statements).

==>Test Cases:
==>The user input cannot be an negative number
==>And Range should be a same number
==>Range should not be zero.

==>Sample input:
Enter any two numbers:
20
100
==>Output:
23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97
