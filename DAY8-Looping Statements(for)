*/ java program using looping statement which is for(loop)
--> program to perform power operation of a particular number which is given by user(Input)/*

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Power
{
 public static void main(String args[])
 {
  int n,p,result=1;
  System.out.println("Enter any number:");
  Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
  n=sc.nextInt();
  System.out.println("Enter the power value:");
  p=sc.nextInt();
  for(int i=1;i<=p;i++)
  {
    result=n*result;
  }
  System.out.println("power of the given number:"+result);   
  sc.close(); 
 }   
}

==>Todays problem:
problem: To perform the power operation using the looping statements(for loop) using java?

==>Solution:This problem is simple and the way,I have implemented by using the for loop.Which is fully based on users choice.

==>Explanation of the topic:

Operations of power is very simple Here I have used the basic for loop.

==>Test cases:
=>The user input cannot be an negative number
=>The Power cannot be Zero.

==>Sample Input:
Enter any number:
9
Enter the power value:
3
==>Output:
power of the given number:729
