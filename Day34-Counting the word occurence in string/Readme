==>Todays problem: program that will read a line and count all occurences of the word 'the' in a String.

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with Strings concept

==>Explanation:
1>Here I have first read a paragraph or a line.
2>And in java,there is a function split("character") that takes a character in a string and for every that character,it split the string seperated by ','.
3>Then I have stored those splitted strings in a String array.
4>Then there is one function equals("word") that takes one word as a parameter, With that function I have checked that every element in the array is matched with it or not.
5>If yes, it will increment the count value.(At first,count is initialised with zero).
6>If not, proceed for the next element in the string array.
7>If it readched to the final element in the array,the count value is calculated.

==>Sample Input:
Enter a line
Paragraph structure isnâ€™t just for the benefit of readers, it also helps authors organize their thoughts and communicate clearly, 
Below we explain the different steps of how to write a paragraph, from the paragraph introduction all the way to the conclusion.

==>Output:
The number of Occurences of "the" are 5
