==>Todays problem: A program To Implement The Single Level Inheritance Which is Completely User Based 

==>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and I have implemented with the Basic Area of Rectangle Concept which is [length * Breadth]

==>Some Basic information regarding the concept:
1>Inheritance is a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class. 
2>In Java, classes may inherit or acquire the properties and methods of other classes. 
3>A class derived from another class is called a subclass, 
4>whereas the class from which a subclass is derived is called a superclass.

-->SINGLE LEVEL INHERITANCE:
1>Single inheritance can be defined as a derived class to inherit the basic methods (data members and variables) and behavior from a superclass.
2>Itâ€™s a basic is-a relationship concept exists here. 
3>Basically, java only uses a single inheritance as a subclass cannot extend more superclass.

==>Explanation:
1>At first class Shape consists of two integer type data members which are length and breadth 
2>And this is also a Super or Parent class.
3>Then another class Rectangle is a Subclass consists of one data member and one function
4>Data Member is area to store integer value and a function CalculateArea()

==>Test Cases:
1>Here the input length,breadth should not be an string,float,double type
2>Similarly the input should not be in negative numbers

==>Sample Input And Outputs:

<<<====Enter Length====>>>
12
<<<===Enter Breadth===>>>
4
<<<====The Area of rectangle of length "12" and breadth "4" is "48"====>>>

<<<====Enter Length====>>>
18
<<<===Enter Breadth===>>>
8
<<<====The Area of rectangle of length "18" and breadth "8" is "144"====>>>
