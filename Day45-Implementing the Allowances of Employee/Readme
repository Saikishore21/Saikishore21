==>Todays problem: Program to Implement the Employee salary and allowances logic which is completely user based.

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with the basic Employee scenario concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we need to create a Employee class Inside that we should take the data from the user
2>And defining the name,salary,da,hra,pf,grossal,netsal in the Employee class
3>Now we should create the one Employee constructor
4>Inside that we need to declare the name,salary,da,hra,pf,grossal,netsal [According to code]
5>Now we need to create one calculate Method then inside that 
6>da is equal to salary*15.0/100 and hra is equal to salary*10.0/100 then pf is equal to salary/*12.0/100
7>Similary grossal is equal to salary+da+hra and netsal is equal to grossal-pf
8>Now we should print Employee name,salary,da,hra,pf,grossal,netsal Inside the display method [According the code]
9>Then inside the main method we need to input form the user that enter the employee name and salary
10>Finally we should call the calculate method and display method [According to code]

==>Test Cases:
1>Here name should not be in int,double,float type
2>And Salary,da,hra,pf,grossal,netsal should not be int,string,float type
