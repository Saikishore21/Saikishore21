====>Todays Problem: Implementing The Java Program using thread class By Extending The Thread Class 

====>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using java threads Concept.

====>Basic Information Regarding the concept:
*A Thread is a very light-weighted process, or we can say the smallest part of the process
**That allows a program to operate more efficiently by running multiple tasks simultaneously.
***A thread is created either by "creating or implementing" the Runnable Interface or by extending the Thread class.
****These are the only two ways through which we can create a thread.

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly Inside the run method we are performing the sum of two numbers 
2>The method is used for starting a thread that we have newly created. 
3>It starts a new thread with a new callstack. After executing the start() method, the thread changes the state from New to Runnable. 
4>It executes the run() method when the thread gets the correct time to execute it.
5>Inside the main method we are calling the start method to execute the run() method of the Thread class.

====>Test Cases:
1>Here the variables a,b should not be float,string,double type

====>Sample Input and Output:

<<<===Thread started running!!!===>>>
<<<<=====Sum of two numbers is :22====>>>>
