====>Todays Problem: Implementing The Java Program using Throw Keyword Block By Throwing Unchecked Exception

====>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using java throw keyword Concept.

====>Basic Information Regarding the concept:
* The Java throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.
** We can throw either checked or unchekedexception in java by throw keyword. 
*** The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exception.

====>Explanation:
1>In The Program Firstly, we have created the validate method that takes integer value as a parameter.
2>If the age is less than 18, we are throwing the ArithmeticException 
3>Otherwise it prints a person is eligible to vote & Rest of Code!!! 

====>Test Cases:
1>Here we should not pass age as float,double,or string type
2>There should not be any syntactical errors in the code, follow the syntax appropriately

*****  throw new exception_class("error message");  ******

====>Sample Input And Output:
1>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: <<<<====Person is not eligible to vote====>>>>
        at UncheckedExceptionThrow.validate(UncheckedExceptionThrow.java:9)
        at UncheckedExceptionThrow.main(UncheckedExceptionThrow.java:20)
        
2>
<<<===Person is eligible to vote!!===>>>
<<<==rest of the code!!!===>>>
