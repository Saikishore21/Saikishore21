==>Todays problem: Program to Sort elements in the array which is completely user based Merge Sort.

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple logic using Arrays concept.

==>Explanation:
1>First we need enter the array size.
2>Then we need to enter the elements in the array.
3>Now we need to divide array in to two halfs that is left sub array and right sub array
4>it is basically divide conquer approach 
5>it will divide the array up to mid value will be 0
6>Now we need to compare both left and right subarrays elements
7>if left subarray element is less than right subarray then element is stored in left sub array
8>Otherwise the element is stored in right subarray
9>Now at last all the elements will be in  sorted order.
10>Then we will print the elememts.

==>Test cases:
The element shoud not be float type,string or double type

==>Sample Input:
Enter size of the Array:
8
Enter elements in the Array:
54
14
18
86
76
51
28
99

==>Output:
Sorted order:
14
18
28
51
54
76
86
99
