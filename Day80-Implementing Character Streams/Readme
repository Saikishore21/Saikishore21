====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program of File Reader & Writer Using Character Streams


====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using Character Streams Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

*Java.io Package:
**This package provides for system input and output through data streams, serialization and the file system.
 ***Java defines two types of streams
  ===>1. Character Stream: It provides a convenient menas for handling input and output of characters.
  ===>2. Byte Stream:It provides a convenient means for handling input and output of byte.
*In Java, characters are stored using Unicode conventions. Character stream automatically allows us to read/write data character by character.
**Character Stream Classes: It is also defined by using two abstract class at the top of hierarchy
1>Reader
2>Writer

====>Explanation:
1>Firstly we need to create a class then we have created a method called fileoperation1()
2>Inside we are performing te input stream here we can copy the file data from one txt file to another file
3>Then we are performing the while loop with condition if it satisfies that particular condition
4>We should print the data of that file And At Last We need to close that file
5>Similarly Perform Same similar conditions for File Output Stream which fileoperation2() and fileoperation3()
6>Inside fileoperation3() we can change image data from one file to another file
7>Lastly Inside the main method we need to create a object then we should call the fileoperation methods


====>Test Cases:
1>Follow the syntax appropriately and copy the path According to Requirement.

====>Sample Input And Output:

*FileOperation1(Output)
Implementing the byte streams:
Connection created:
i love java
Data retreived:

**FileOperation2(Output)
Connection created:
data written

***FileOperation3(Output)
Connection created:
data copied
