==>Todays problem: Program to Implement the Multiple Catch Block using Exception Handling Concept

==>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented with Multiple Catch Block Concept.

==>Some Basic information regarding the concept:
1>An exception (or exceptional event) is a problem that arises during the execution of a program.
2>An exception can occur for many different reasons. Following are some scenarios where an exception occurs
3>A user has entered an invalid data.
4> In a Java program, at any instance of time, only one exception can occur. Also, at any point, only one catch block is executed.
5>The multiple catch blocks should be ordered in such a way that the catch block for most specific exceptions should come first and then the general.

==>Explanation:
1>In the above program Firstly an ArithmeticException that is caught in the first catch block is raised.
2>Then If this catch block was not specified, then the exception would have go to the generalized catch block.

==>Test Cases:
1>There should not be syntactical errors in the code.
2>slightly modify the above program so that the try block raises two exceptions.

==>Sample Input And Output:

try Block:: Begin
Arithmetic Exception :: Divide by zero!!
rest of the code
