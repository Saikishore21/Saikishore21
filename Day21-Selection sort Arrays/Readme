==>Todays problem: Program to Sort elements in the array which is completely user based Selection Sort.

==>Solution:

Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple logic using Arrays concept.

==>Explanation:
1>First we need enter the array size.
2>Then we need to enter the elements in the array.
3>Now the variable i starts from 0 to n-1 then i will be incremented
4>i will be stored in loc(variable)
5>Now variable j starts from i+1 to n then j will be incremented
6>And variable j will be stored in loc(variable)
7>Now we need to take a temporary varaiable temp that stores arr[i] value
8>later arr[i] value equals to arr[loc]
9>Then arr[loc] equals to temp
10>Now elements will be in sorted order Then we need to print arr[i] values Those are in sorted order.

==>Testcases:
The elements should not float type,String type or double type.

==>Sample Input:
Enter size of the Array:
8
Enter elements in the Array:
20
10
86
35
54
68
75
85

==>Output:
Sorted order:
10
20
35
54
68
75
85
86
