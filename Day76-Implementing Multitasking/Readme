====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program using to perform multiple tasks by multiple threads (multitasking in multithreading)

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using java Multithreading Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:
* Multitasking is a process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously. 
** We use multitasking to utilize the CPU. Multitasking can be achieved in two ways:
*** Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)
**** Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)

====>Explanation:

1>Firstly Class Simple1 extending the thread class
2>Now Inside the run method we are printing the statement task one 
3>Similarly Another class Simple2 extending the thread class
4>Inside the run method we are printing the statement task two
5>Now Inside the main method we are creating the two classes objects And calling with start method

====>Sample Input And Output:

task two
task one
