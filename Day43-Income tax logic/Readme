=>Todays problem: Program to perform the Income tax operation according to the users amount

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with basic income tax scenario concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we should create the class of income tax 
2>Now we need to check the condition that the amount should greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100000
3>If the above condition is true then tax is zero
4>Again we should check one more condition that the amount should greater than or equal to 100001 and less than or equal to 500000
5>If the condition is true then the tax will be calculated Accordingly like [income-100000]*0.1+[100000*0]==>(According to code)
6>If the income increases more than 500000 then again we should check the condition
7>Now if the amount is greater than or equal to 500001 and less than or equal to 1000000
8>If the condition is true then the tax will be calculated Accordingly like [income-500000]*0.2+[500000*0.1]==>(According to code)
9>Similarly if the amount is greater than or equal to 1000001 and less than or equal to 4000000
10>If the condition is true then the tax will be calculated Accordingly like [income-1000000]*0.3+[1000000*0.2]==>(According to code)
11>Lastly if the tax is more than 4000000 then tax will be calculated as [income-4000000]0.37+[4000000*0.3]==>(Accordingly to code)


==>Test Cases:
The Element should not be Charcter type,Float type or Double type


==>Sample Inputs and Outputs:

Enter the yearly income
50000
The total tax for the income is 0

Enter the yearly income
125000
The total tax for the income is 2500

Enter the yearly income
200000
The total tax for the income is 10000

Enter the yearly income
250000
The total tax for the income is 15000
