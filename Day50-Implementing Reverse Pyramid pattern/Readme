==>Todays problem: Program to Implement the printing reverse pyrmaid pattern logic which is completely User based.

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with the basic Arrays & printing pattern concept.

==>Explanation:
1>Here first take input of row size.
2>Then for every row run a loop1 i from 0 to rows-1 and that is outer loop.
3>Then run an inner loop2 j from j<=i to 2 for empty space inside loop1 and print the empty space.[According to code]
4>After loop2 completion,run loop3 from 0 to rows-1-i for number of columns and print * in its body.

==>Test Cases:
1>The Given Input should not be in float,String or Double type
2>And Input should not be in negative numbers

==>Sample Inputs & Outputs:

Enter the number of rows:
12
