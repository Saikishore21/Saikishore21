==>Todays problem: A program To Implement Interface in java Calculating the 20% tax on Employee Income and displaying the details of Employee including the 
                   tax to be paid by the Employee.
 
==>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented with Java Interface concept to get 100% security for the data.


==>Some Basic information regarding the concept:
1>The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body.
2>It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
3>In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body.


==>INTERFACE IN JAVA :
1>An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.


==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we should to create the interface of employee class then assigned EmpId,Emp name,Emp Salary
2>Now we need to create another class Information here iit is implementing the Employee class[According to code]
3>Then we should performe the income tax (logic) to calculate the particular salary
4>Later we need to create the display method Inside that we should print the appropriate details of that particular Employee
5>Lastly Inside the main method we should call the get.data & display methods[According to code]

==>Test Cases:
1>Here the Input data type must be compatible to the declaration data type.

==>Sample Inputs and Outputs:

<<<====Employee Details are====>>>>
<<<====Employee Id: 105119====>>>
<<<====Employee Name: Saikishore====>>>
