====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program using to perform Multiple task by multiple threads by performing scenario 
                     Write a multithreading program by using runnable interface in which run() method should perform the following task
                     *Display a time stamp
                     **Display greeting message for 10 times (such as hi, hello, good morning)
                     ***Wait for 1000 miliseconds

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using java Multithreading Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

* Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
** A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. 
*** Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.
**** Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation, etc.

====>Explantion:
1>Firstly we have created a class which implements the runnable interface
2>Then we are performing the run method and try block Inside that we are performing the for loop then creating the object for date
3>And performing the thread sleep as 1000 Now we are catching the exception then we are printing the exception
4>Now we are creating the another class message which is implements the runnable interface
5>Similarly performing the same run method and looping but the major change is here we are printing the message 'Hello'
6>Later performing same catching the exception and printing the exception
7>Now Inside the main method we are creating the object for timestamp class and similarly for message class
8>Then we are performing start method with the help of threads t1 &t2.

====>Test Cases:
1>Follow the syntax appropriately and perform the looping according to scenario
2>For Timestamp scenarios we have import java.util.Date

====>Sample Input And Output:
