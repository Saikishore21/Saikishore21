====>Todays Problem: Implementing the java program using Finally Block by Exception Handling

====>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented with Finally Block Concept.

====>Explanation:
1>If the try block does not raise any exception then the finally block will be executed after the try block. 
2>If there is an exception in the try block then control will pass to the catch block first and then the finally block.
3>An exception occurring in finally block behaves in the same way as any other exception. 
4>Even if the try block contains a return statement or branching statements like break and continue, then the finally block will still be executed.

====>The general syntax of the finally block is as follows:

try {
</em><em>                         //code that might raise exception
</em><em>            }catch {   
</em><em>                       //code that handles exception
</em><em>            }finally {
</em><em>                          //mandatory code to be executed
</em><em>            }


====>Test Cases:
1>There should not be syntactical errors in the code.
**Though finally block is always executed, there are certain situations or cases in which it doesnâ€™t execute.
2>When the thread is dead.
3>When the System.exit() method is used.
4>When an exception occurs in the finally block.


====>Sample Input And Output:

<<<<=====::Try Block::======>>>>
<<<<<======Result=====>>>>:25
<<<<======:: Finally Block::=====>>>>
<<<====No Exception::finally block executed===>>>
!!!!!rest of the code...!!!!
