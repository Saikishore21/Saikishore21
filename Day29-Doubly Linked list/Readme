==>Todays problem: Program to perform all operations like creation insertion and traversal using Doubly linked list

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple Linked list Concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we need to create the node then we need take input form the user that Enter the data
2>If the head is equal to null then head will be equals to new _node and tail will be equal to new_node
3>Otherwise we need to take input from user that to enter 1 to insert at begining,and enter 2 to insert at last,and for enter 3 to insert at specific location
4>Then we need to use switch case for begining new_node.next is equals to head and head.prev will be equals to new node then head is equal to new_node
5>Now for insertion at last tail.next is equal to new_node and new_node.prev is equal to tail then tail is equal to new_node
6>Then for insertion at specific location we need to take input from the user that to specify the position of node to be inserted
7>And we should perform the for loop,Here i value starts from 0 to p-1 then it will be incremented and inside the loop temp is equal to ptr 
8>Then ptr is equal to ptr.next and new_node.prev is equal to temp then new_node.next is equal to ptr 
9>temp.next is equal to new_node and ptr.prev is equal to new_node
10>In the Similar way we need to implement the delete operation but we need to do Slight Modifications according to the operation & linked list
11>Then for traversing operation if the head is equals to null then we need to print the linked list is empty
12>Otherwise we should print the temp.data and temp is equal to temp.next
13>Now inside the main method we need to call All operations of creation,deletion,traversal.

==>Testcases:
The element shoud not be float type,string or double type
