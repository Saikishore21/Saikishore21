==>Todays problem: Program to Implement the Hollow Square Pattern Logic.

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with the basic Arrays & printing pattern concept.

==>Explanation:
1>Here first intialize the n value according the user
2>Now inside the loop i starts from one to n then i will be incremented
3>Similarly j starts from one to n and j will get incremented [According to code]
4>Now we should check the condition that i==1 || j==1 || i==n || j==n
5>Here If the condition is true then we will print *
6>Otherwise Inside the else condition we will print Empty Space and we will exit from the loop

==>Test Cases:
1>The Given Intialization should not be in float,String or Double type
2>And Input should not be in negative numbers

==>Sample Inputs & Outputs:
//Here n=20
