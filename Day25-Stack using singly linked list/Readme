==>Todays problem: Program to perform all operations like push pop and display using stack singly linked list

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple Linked list Concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we need to create a node then we need to create the push operation.
2>Now we need to take input from the user that to "enter the data" then if top is equal to null then top is equal to new_node
3>Otherwise new_noed.next is equal to top then top is equal to new_node
4>Now we need to create the pop operation in that if top is equal to null then stack will be empty
5>Otherwise node temp equals to top and temp equals to temp.next
6>And top is equals to temp 
7>Then display method we need to create here node temp value is equals to top
8>And then we will have a condition that temp is not equal to null if the condition is true then we will print the tempdata
9>Then temp is equals to temp.next
10>Now inside the main method we need to take input from the user that to press 1 to push,press 2 to pop,press 3 to display And enter your choice
11>Then we need to use the switch case for push pop and display 
12>Now At last we need to take input from the user that whether Enter 0 to go to main menu and to exit Succesfully.

==>Testcases:
The element shoud not be float type,string or double type

==>Sample input and output:
press1 to push:
press2 to pop:
press3 to display:
enter your choice:
1
enter data:
