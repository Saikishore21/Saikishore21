==>Todays problem: Program to perform all operations like Enqueue,Dequeue and display using Queue doubly linked list

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple Linked list Concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we need to create a node then we need to create the Enqueue operation.
2>Now we need to take input from the user that to "enter the data" then if Front is equal to null then front is equal to new_node and Rear is equal to new_node
3>Otherwise new_node.next is equal to null and new_node.prev will be equal to rear then rear.next is equal to new_node 
4>And rear is eqaul to new_node, Now we should create dequeue operation 
5>Inside that we need to check the condition that front is equal to null then if the condition is true then we need to print the underflow
6>Otherwise front is equal to front.next and front.prev is equal to null
7>Then finally we need to  create the display operation.
8>Inside that we  should check the condition that front is equal to null if the condition is true then we need to print queue is empty
9>Otherwise we need to consider the temp is equal to null then we should check the condition that temp is not equal to null inside the while loop(According to code) 
10>Now we should print the temp.data then later temp is equal to temp.next
11>Now inside the main method take input from the user that press1 to enqueue,press2 to dequeue and press3 to display & Enter your choice
12>Then we need to use the switch case for Enqueue,Dequeue and display operations 
13>Now At last we need to take input from the user that whether Enter 0 to go to main menu and to exit Succesfully.

==>Testcases:
The element shoud not be float type,string or double type

==>Sample Input and Output:

Enter 1 to enqueue:
Enter 2 to dequeue:
Enter 3 to display:
Enter your choice:
1
Enter data:
60
Enter 0 to go to the main menu:
Enter any key to exist
0
Enter 1 to enqueue:
Enter 2 to dequeue:
Enter 3 to display:
Enter your choice:
1
Enter data:
10
Enter 0 to go to the main menu:
Enter any key to exist
0
Enter 1 to enqueue:
Enter 2 to dequeue:
Enter 3 to display:
Enter your choice:
1
Enter data:
20
Enter 0 to go to the main menu:
Enter any key to exist
0
Enter 1 to enqueue:
Enter 2 to dequeue:
Enter 3 to display:
Enter your choice:
1
Enter data:
30
Enter 0 to go to the main menu:
Enter any key to exist
0
Enter 1 to enqueue:
Enter 2 to dequeue:
Enter 3 to display:
Enter your choice:
2
Enter 0 to go to the main menu:
Enter any key to exist
0
Enter 1 to enqueue:
Enter 2 to dequeue:
Enter 3 to display:
Enter your choice:
3
The remaining elements in the Queue:
10
20
30
Enter 0 to go to the main menu:
Enter any key to exist
2
Exit is succesfully done!!!
