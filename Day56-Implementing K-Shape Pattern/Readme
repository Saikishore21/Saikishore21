==>Todays problem: A program To Implement the K-Shape Printing Pattern Using Integers

==>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and I have implemented with the basic Looping & printing pattern concept.

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we should initialize the variables i,j and declare rows is equal to 9
2>Now we should perform the for loop inside that i is equal to rows and less than or equals to 1 then i will get decremented
3>Again we should perform another for loop here j starts from 1 and greater than eqaul to i then j will get incremented
4>Now we need to print the j and to get space in between the integers we should print one more empty print statement
5>The above conditions are for upper half pattern 
6>Similarly we will perform the same optimized conditions for lower half pattern[According to code]

==>TestCases:
1>1>The Given Input declartion Should not be float,String,Double Type
2>And Input should not be in negative numbers

==>Sample Input && Output:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1 2 3 4 5 6
