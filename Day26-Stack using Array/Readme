==>Todays problem: Program to perform all operations like push pop and display using Stack array

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple Stack &array concepts

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we need to create the array And we should perform the  various Operations of push pop and display
2>Then we need to check the condition that if top is equal to n-1 or not
3>If the condition is true then we need to print that stack is overflow
4>Otherwise we need to take input from the user And we need to store the elements in the array.
5>Then we need to print Item inserted.
6>Later we need to create the pop operation then we should check the condition that top is equals to n-1
7>If the condition is true we need to print stack is underfow 
8>Otherwise we need to take input from the user And we need to delete the Appropriate element in the array.
9>Then we should print the element is item is deleted.
10>Now we need to create the display operation And we should check the condition that topnis equal to -1
11>If the condition is true Then we need to print stack is empty
12>Otherwise we need print the elements which are stored in the array After performing all operations 
13>Now we should take the user input that press 1 to get push operation,2 to get pop operation And 3 to get display operation
14>After entering the user's input Appropriate operation will be performed accordingly
15>Finally we need to exit from that operations

==>Testcases:
The element shoud not be float type,string or double type
