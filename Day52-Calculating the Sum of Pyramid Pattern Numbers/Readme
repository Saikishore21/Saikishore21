==>Todays problem: A program which will print a pyramid of "numbers" 's of height "n" and print the sum of all number's in the pyramid.

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with the basic Looping & printing pattern concept.

==>Explanation:
1>Here first we need to take Input from the user that, to "Enter the number of Rows"
2>Now inside the loop i starts from one to n then i will be incremented
3>Similarly j starts from one to n and j will get incremented [According to code j is space]
4>Then we will print an empty space Later we will perform one more loop that is (while)
5>Inside that there will be condition that [k<=2*i-1] Then we will print the k value.
6>Then Sum will be equal to sum+k [According to code] then k will be incremented.
7>At Last we will print the sum of numbers inside the pattern According to user Input choice

==>Test Cases:
1>The Given User Input should not be in float,String or Double type
2>And Input should not be in negative numbers

==>Sample Input And Outputs:

Enter the no of rows:
8
              1
            1 2 3
          1 2 3 4 5
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7
      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
<<<=============================>>>
Sum of the numbers: 372
