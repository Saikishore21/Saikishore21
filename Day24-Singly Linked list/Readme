==>Todays problem: Program to perform all operations like creation insertion and traversal using singly linked list

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple Linked list Concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we need to create the node then we need take input form the user that Enter the data
2>if the head is equal to null then head will be equals to new _node
3>Otherwise we need to take input from user that to enter 1 to insert at begining,and enter 2 to insert at last,and for enter 3 to insert at specific location
4>Then we need to use switch case for begining new_node.next is equals to head and head will be equals to new node
5>And for insertion at last we need to store head value in node temp then we need check condition that temp.next is not equal to null
6>If the condition is true then temp is equals to temp.next
7>Then temp.next is equals to new_node
8>Now for specific location we need to take input from the user that Enter position of node to be inserted
9>Then we need store head value in node temp then we need check condition that variable i value starts from 0 to n-1 and we need to increment the i.
10>later we need to store temp value is equals to temp.next
11>new_node.next is equals to temp1.next then new_node is equals to temp1.next
12>Now Again we need to take user input that do you want to Add more data if yes press1
13>In the Similar way we need to implement the delete operation but we need to do Slight Modifications
14>Then for traversing operation if the head is equals to null then we need to print the temp.data
15>Otherwise we need to check the condition that temp is not equal to null then we need to print the temp.data4
16>And we need to store the temp is equals to temp.next
17>Now inside the main method we need to call All operations of creation,deletion,traversal.

==>Testcases:
The element shoud not be float type,string or double type
