=>Todays problem: Program to perform that Randomly picks an English Alphabet program

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with Strings concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we should create the object of Random then we need to take all the alphabets And convert to Array
2>Then we need to take the rand.nextInt method and write A-Z alphabets to convert in to [to.charArray()]
3>Intially flag will be zero and count is also zero
4>Now we need to check the condition that flag not equal to one
5>If the condition is true then we should print Enter a letter in Capital letter from A to Z which is According to code
6>Now Again we need to check the condition that char is equal to input 
7>If the condition is true then simply print you have guessed the character with (count+1) times
8>Here flag will be equal to one. Otherwise we should increment the count value And then flag is equal to zero

==>Test cases:
The element should not be Integer type,Float type or Double type

==>Sample Input and Output:

==================================================
Enter a letter in Upper Case from A-Z
A
==================================================
Enter a letter in Upper Case from A-Z

K
<====================================================>
