==>Todays problem: Program to perform all operations like push pop and display using Stack Array

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple Stack & Arrays Concept.

==>Explanation:
1>First we need to create an array Then we need to perform all operations those are push,pop and display
2>Now if top is equal to n-1 Then stack will be under overflow condition
3>Otherwise we need to take input from the user that to enter the data in the array
4>Now we need to store that particular data in the array Then we need to print that item inserted in the array
5>Then we need to create the pop operation and we should check the condition that if top is equal to -1 
6>If the Condition is true we should print Stack will be underflow condition
7>Otherwise we need to delete that particular element in the array 
8>Now we need to create the display operation and we should check that top is equals to -1 or not 
9>If the condition is true then we need to print the statement that the stack is empty 
10>If the condition is false then we should print the remaining elements which are stored the array
11>After performing all the operations we need to exit from the particular array

==>Testcases:
The element shoud not be float type,string or double type
