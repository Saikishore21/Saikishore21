==>Todays problem: A program To Implement the Sandglass Pattern which is completely User based

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with the basic Looping & printing pattern concept.

==>Explanation:
1>Here firstly we need to take Input from the User to enter the number of rows you want to print.
2>Now we should perform the for loop here i is equal to 0 to n-1 then i will be incremented
3>Similarly one more for loop here j starts from 0 to i and j will be incremented
4>Now we should print an empty space then we need to preform another for loop here k is equal to i and k <=n-1 then k will get incremented
5>Inside that we will print the * and empty spaces to get the spaces inside the pattern
6>The above points are for upper part of sandglass pattern [According to code]
7>Similarly we should follow reverse conditions for the lower part of sandglass pattern so that we will get perfect pattern

==>TestCases:
1>The Given Input Should not be float,String,Double Type
2>And Input should not be in negative numbers

==>Sample Input and Output:

<<<<=====Enter the number of rows you want to print=====>>>>: 16
