====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program using to perform Multiple task by multiple threads by performing scenario 

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using java Multithreading Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

* Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
** A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. 
*** Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.
**** Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation, etc.

====>Explantion:

1>Firstly we have created the saves class And we are assigning the n value to i With the help of the constructor.
2>Inside the increment method we are incrementing the n value And we are printing the value of n.
3>Then we are displaying the value of n
4>Now we are performing the multithreading operation here we are performing the loop in try block
5>And Exception is caught in Catch block which is performing inside the Increment Class
6>Similarly we are creating another display class which is performing the similar operations like Increment class
7>Now Inside the main method we are asking user to enter the number
8>Then we are creating three objects for three different classes then we should call by using the start method. 

===>Test Cases:
1>Here the number should not be in string,float,or double type

===>Sample Input And Output:

Enter a number
10
n value incremented by 1  and it becomes 11
The n value is 10
n value incremented by 1  and it becomes 12
The n value is 12
n value incremented by 1  and it becomes 13
The n value is 13
n value incremented by 1  and it becomes 14
The n value is 14
n value incremented by 1  and it becomes 15
The n value is 15
