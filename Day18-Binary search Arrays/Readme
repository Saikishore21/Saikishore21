==>Todays problem: Program to Search elements in the array which is completely user based (Binary-Searching)

==>Solution:

Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple logic using Arrays concept.
   
==>Explanation:
1>First we need enter the array size.
2>Then we need to enter the elements in the array.
3>Now we need to enter searching element in the array.
4>Now it checks the condition whether the element in found in the array or not.
5>If the element is found then it prints element is found in the array with approriate index value.
6>If the element is not found then it prints element is not found in the array.
7>The main difference of linear and binary search is :
==>It is not mandatory to be in sorted order for linear search 
==>But it is mandatory in binary search that the array should be in sorted order.

==>Sample Input:
enter size of the Array:
5
enter elements in the Array:
10
30
50
70
90

==>Output:

enter which element do you want:
70
element found in array at index:3

enter which element do you want:
75
element not found
