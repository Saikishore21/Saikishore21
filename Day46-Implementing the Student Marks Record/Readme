==>Todays problem: Program to Implement the Student marks record which will calculate the percentage of a particular student

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with the basic percentage formula concept

==>Explanation:

1>Firstly we need to create a Student class Inside that we should define the name,marks,percentage [which is according to code]
2>Then we take input from the user that to enter the roll no and also enter your name
3>Now we need to perform the loop inside that we should print the marks of that particular student
4>Then we should calculate the percentage which is [according to code]
5>Now we need to create one display method inside that we should print the roll no,name,marks And percentage of all subjects.
6>Finally Inside the main method we will call the both methods those are readmarks and displaymarks

==>Test Cases:
1>Here name should not be in int,double,float type
2>And marks,percentage should not be int,string,float type

==>Sample Input and Output:

Enter Roll_no
22
Enter your Name
pavan
Enter the 1 subject marks
54
Enter the 2 subject marks
86
Enter the 3 subject marks
95
Enter the 4 subject marks
85
Enter the 5 subject marks
99
Your rollNo = 22
Your name = pavan
1 subject marks = 54
2 subject marks = 86
3 subject marks = 95
4 subject marks = 85
5 subject marks = 99
The percentage is = 83.8
