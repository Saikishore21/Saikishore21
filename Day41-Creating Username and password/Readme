=>Todays problem: Program to create the username and password which is completely user based 

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with Strings concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we take input from the user that to Enter username and password
2>Now we should check the condition that Username is not equal to empty 
3>And inside that we should check one more condition Username length need to be greater than or equal to 6 and it should be less than or equal to 15
4>If the condition is true we will check the first letter should be in upper case
5>For these if the condition is false of particular formats like if you enter any special characters or any white spaces
6>And if you give any paranthesis simply we will print please provide the perfect user name
7>Again the compilier checks if the user provide below 6 characters, then we will print that password length must be 8 to 256 characters
8>If the user gives same input and password for these scenario we will check the condition that username.equals(pass)
9>Then we will print user name and password cannot be same
10>Otherwise we will print the user name and password is successfully verified

==>Test cases:
The element shoud not be Float type or Double type

==>Sample Input and Output:

Enter Username
Vangala
Enter password
Saikishore@21
=========================================================
Username and password is successfully verified!!!!!
