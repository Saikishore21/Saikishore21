==>Todays problem: A program To Implement the Hollow Diamond Printing Pattern  

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with the basic Looping & printing pattern concept.

==>Explanation:
1>Here firstly we need to create the class And Now Inside the Main Method we should perform the logic. 
2>Now inside the loop i starts from one to 5 then i will be incremented.
3>Similarly we will take another loop here j starts from 1 to 5-i+1 and j will be incremented [According to code]
4>Then Again we will perform another loop which is j it starts from 1 to 5-i+1 and j will be incremented
5>Here we will print * And we will print one more statement empty one for new line [According to code]
6>Till now we have done Upper side of the Hollow Diamond pattern
7>In the Similar way we will implement for Lower side of pattern refer the code accordingly

==>Test Cases:
1>The Given Input should not be in float,String or Double type
2>And Input should not be in negative numbers

==>Sample Outputs:
