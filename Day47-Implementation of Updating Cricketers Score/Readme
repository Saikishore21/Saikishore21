==>Todays problem: Program to Implementation of updating cricketers Individual score and displaying the information of that particular player

==>Solution:

1>Firstly we need to create a class Inside that we should take the data from the user
2>And defining the First name,Last name,RunsMade,No_of_fours,No_of_Sixes in the Cricket class
3>Now we should create the one Method Intial value[According to code]
4>Then we should take input from the user that to Enter the first name,Last name,run made,no of fours,no of sixes
5>Again we need to create updated_run [According to code]
6>Now we should take input from the user to give the updated run
7>Then we will print the information of that particular cricketer that is first name,last name,no of fours,no of sixes And Updated runs of the player 
8>Now finally Inside the main method we will call the three methods those are intial_value,updated_run,Info[According to code]

==>Test cases:
1>Here first name,Last name should not be in int,float,double type
2>And Runs made,No_of_fours,No_of_sixes should not be in String,float,double type
