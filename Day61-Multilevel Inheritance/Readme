==>Todays problem: A program To Implement The Multi Level Inheritance Which is Completely User Based 

==>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and I have implemented with the Basic Student Marks & Total Concept.

==>Some Basic information regarding the concept:

==>MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE :
The multi-level inheritance includes the involvement of atleast two or more than two classes.One class inherits the features from a parent class and the newly created
sub-class becomes the base class for another class.

==>Explanation:
Here I have used Multilevel Inheritance concept to implement the logic.
Here the first class "Student" is a parent class and it contains two instance variables "sno" and "sname" which stores some data about student.
Then I have created another class "Test" which inherits "Student" class and contains three instance variables which stores marks of three subjects.
At Last I have created another class "Result" which inherits "Test" class.Then "Result" class can use "Student" and "Test" class properties also.

==>Test Cases:
1>Here The Input student reg_no should not be in float and double type
2>Similarly The input of the marks of various subjects should not be in float,string,double type

==>Sample Inputs And Outputs:

<<<<====Enter Student details:====>>>>
Student Registration Number
22MCA10086
<<<====Student Name====>>>
Chandu
<<<====Enter marks of three subjects====>>>
<<==Science==>>
91
<<==Maths==>>
95
<<==English==>>
98
<<<<=====The student details are===''==>>>>
<<<<<====Registration Number: 22MCA10086====>>>>>
<<<<====Name: Chandu====>>>>
<<<<====Total Marks: 284.0====>>>>
