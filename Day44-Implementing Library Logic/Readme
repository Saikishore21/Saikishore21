==>Todays problem: Program to implement the library logic which is completely user based.

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with the  basic library scenario concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we need to create the a class of library, Inside that we should take the input from the user
2>That to Enter the book name,Author name,Book number,and Book publisher,book price,And number of copy issued
3>Now we need to check the condition that (Issue book) whether the users book number is equal to library's book number or not
4>And the other condition is book name
5>Here the book number and book name both must & should match with the users input
6>If the both a bove condition is true then we will print the your book is issued succesfully
7>Otherwise simply we will print book is not available
8>Now we need to check one more condition that (Return book) whether the users book number is equal to library's book number or not
9>And the other condition which is book name
10>Here the book number and book name both must & should match with the users input
11>If the both a bove condition is true then we will print the your book is Returned succesfully
12>Otherwise simply we will print book is not available
13>Then finally we will print the complete details regarding the book name,Author name,Book number,and Book publisher,book price,And number of copy issued
14>These are the major points involved in the Library program.

==>Test cases:
1>Here book name,Author name,publisher name should not be in int,float,double types
2>And book no,book price & number of copies should not in string,float,double types

==>Sample Input & Output:
