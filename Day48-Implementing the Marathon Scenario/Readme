==>Todays problem: Program to Implement the Marathon Scenario which is completely User based.

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with the basic Arrays concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we need to create a Array for name of the participants which is String array
2>Then create another array for the time taken of that particular participant
3>Now we need to create a loop Inside that i starts from 0 to 7 then i will be incremented [According to code]
4>Then we should check which participant have took the minimum time when compared with the others
5>Now we need to check the condition that time[i] is greater than min1 
6>If the condition is true then we will assign min1 equal to time[i] then Again we should check i is equal to 0
7>If the condition satisfies then name1 is equal to name[i] {//According to code//}
8>Similary These process repeated for min2 player as shown as min1 player
9>Finally At last we will print both the winner & runner and we will specify their particular time

==>Test Cases:
1>Here for String array should not be in int,float,double type 
2>Time array should be in float,double,String type

==>Sample Input & Output:

<<<===Enter the name and time of participant 1===>>>
Pavan
5
<<<===Enter the name and time of participant 2===>>>
Chandu
3
<<<===Enter the name and time of participant 3===>>>
Madhu
8
<<<===Enter the name and time of participant 4===>>>
Nithin
12
<<<===Enter the name and time of participant 5===>>>
Naresh
9
<<<===Enter the name and time of participant 6===>>>
Abhilash
7
<<<===Enter the name and time of participant 7===>>>
Kishore
2
===========================================================================
<<<<========The winner is Kishore has taken 2 minutes======>>>>
<<<<========The Runner is Chandu has taken 3 minutes======>>>>
