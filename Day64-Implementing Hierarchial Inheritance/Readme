==>Todays problem: A program To Implement the Hierarchial Inheritance in java based on Initialising the values to the Account holder 
                And withdraw some money from Savings account and calculate the rate of interest on amount in Fixed account,
                then display the results.

==>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented with Hierarchial Inheritance Concept.

==>Some Basic information regarding the concept:
**HIERARCHIAL INHERITANCE :
We already know that "Hierarchical inheritance" occurs when multiple child classes inherit the methods and properties of the same parent class.
This simply means we have only one superclass and multiple sub-classes in hierarchical inheritance in Java.

==>Explanation:
1>Here we need to use Java Hierarchial Inheritance concept to implement the logic.
2>At first we have created one class "Account" and it contains account number and name of the account holder.And this is the Super class.
Then we should create one another class "Savings" which inherits the "Account" class.It has one method "withdraw()" to debit money from the customer account.
4>Later we need to create one another class "Fixed" inherits the "Account" class and it has one method "interest()" to calculate the interest on money in Fixed Account.

==>Test Cases:
1>Here Account no,Saving Account,Fixed Account and Withdrawn should not be float,string,double type
2>Account Holder Name should not be int,float,double data type.

==>Sample Input and Output:

<<<====Enter Account number====>>>
105119
<<<====Enter Name of Account holder====>>>
Saikishore
<<<<=====Enter the Balance in Savings Account=====>>>
5000
<<<<=====Enter the balance in Fixed Account=====>>>>>
10000

<<<<=====Enter the amount to be withdrawn=====>>>>
2000

<<<<<=======After withdrawn, the account details are======>>>>>
-------------------------------------------
105119 Saikishore 3000.0
-------------------------------------------


<<<<====The interest on 10000.0 is 1200.0====>>>>
<<<<=====The account details after adding interset about 6 rate of interest for 2 years of time is====>>>>
-----------------------------------
105119 Saikishore 11200.0
-----------------------------------
