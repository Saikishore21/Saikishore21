=>Todays problem: Program that takes first, middle, and other names except the last name by their first letter. 

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with Strings concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we take input from the user that to enter the string
2>And in java,there is a function split("character") that takes a character in a string and for every that character,it split the string seperated by ','.
3>Then we perform the loop that i starts from 0 to n then i will be incremented
4>Then we need to check the condition that i should be less than n-1 and char value stores the str value
5>Again we should check the condition that (i==0) if the condition is true then name is equal to name and char[According to code]
6>Else name is equal to name and stringarr[i]
7>Finally we need to print the name so that it will print first letters of the first name,middle name then it will print the Last name 

==>Test Cases:
The element shoud not be Float type,Integer or Double type

==>Sample Input and Output:

Enter the string
Arepally krishnaprasad Goud
A k Goud

Enter the string
Gottipati Venkata Naga Pavan
G V N Pavan

Enter the string
Ambati Sahan Goud
