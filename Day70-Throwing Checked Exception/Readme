====>Todays Problem: Implementing The Java Program using Throw Keyword Block By Throwing Checked Exception

====>Solution:
Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using java throw keyword Concept.

====>Basic Information Regarding the concept:
* The Java throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.
** We can throw either checked or unchekedexception in java by throw keyword. 
*** The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exception.


====>Explanation:
1>If we throw a checked exception using throw keyword 
2>it is must to handle the exception using catch block or the method must declare it using throws declaration.
3>Here we have implemented by using file reader and buffer reader concept which comes under Streams Concept.
4>By Using try catch blocks we have implemented the Checked Exceptions concept.
5>Here Inside catch block we have called e.printStackTrace() which is used for print this Throwable along with other details like class name
  And line number where the exception occurred means its backtrace. 
  
====>Test Cases:
1>There should not be any syntactical errors in the code, follow the syntax appropriately.

<==> throw new IOException("sorry device error"); <===>

====>Sample Input And Output:

java.io.FileNotFoundException
        at CheckedExceptionThrow.FileOperation1(CheckedExceptionThrow.java:13)
        at CheckedExceptionThrow.main(CheckedExceptionThrow.java:21)
<<<===rest of the code!!!===>>>
