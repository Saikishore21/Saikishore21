==>program to perform swapping of two numbers without third variable.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Swap
{
 public static void main(String args[])
 {
   int a,b;
   System.out.println("Enter any two numbers:");
   Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
   a=sc.nextInt();
   b=sc.nextInt();
   System.out.println("Before Swapping :"+a+" "+b);
   a=a+b;
   b=a-b;
   a=a-b;
   System.out.println("After Swapping:"+a+" "+b);
 }   
}
==>Todays problem: program to perform the swapping operation without using third variable.

==>Solution:
Here this problem is very simple Here I have implemented with simple logic:
a=a+b;
b=a-b;
a=a-b;

==>Test Cases:
Here both numbers cannot be same.

==>Sample Input:
Enter any two numbers:
10
25

==>Output:
Before swapping :10 25
After Swapping:25 10
