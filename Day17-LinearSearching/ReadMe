==>Todays problem: Program to Search elements in the array which is completely user based (Linear-Searching)

==>Solution:

Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple logic using Arrays concept.
   
==>Explanation:

1>First we need enter the array size.
2>Then we need to enter the elements in the array.
3>Now we need to enter searching element in the array.
4>Now it checks the condition whether the element in found in the array or not.
5>If the element is found then it prints element is found in the array with approriate index value.
6>If the element is not found then it prints element is not found in the array.

==>TestCases:
The elements should not float type,String type.

==>Sample Input:
Enter the length of the array:
5
Enter the elements 5 in the array:
10
40
120
140
200

==>Output:
Enter the searching element in the array:140
140 index found at :3
Enter the searching element in the array:86
Element not found in the array
