==>Todays problem: program that will check the string whether it is palindrome or not. 

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with Strings concept

==>Explanation:
1>First we need to take input from the user
2>Then we should reverse the given string which is provided by the user
3>Now we should perform the for loop then i is equal to length-1 and i will be greater than or equal to zero and i will be decremented
4>And reverse equal to rev+str.charAt(i) According to code
5>Then we need to check the condition that org.equals to rev then we should print it is an palindrome
6>Otherwise we should print it is not an palindrome

==>Test Cases:
The element shoud not be Float type,Integer or Double type

==>Sample Input and Output:
==>1
enter a string
madam
it is an palindrome

==>2
enter a string
pavan
it is not an palindrome

==>3
enter a string
nitin
it is an palindrome
