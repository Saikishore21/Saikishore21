==>Todays problem: program that will count the number of vowels in a sentence

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with Strings concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we need to take input from the user that to enter a line
2>Now we will assign the intial value that count is equal to 0 Then we should perform the for loop According to code
3>Here i starts from 0 to str.length and then i will be incremented
4>Now we should check the condition that whether the ch is equal to 'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u'
5>Then we should increment the count 
6>Finally we should print the count which will print the vowels

==>Test Cases:
The element shoud not be Float type,Integer or Double type

==>Sample Inputs & Outputs

Enter a line
Virat kohli is my favourite cricketer in our indian team
The number of vowels present in the line are 21

Enter a line
sunrises in the east
The number of vowels present in the line are 7
