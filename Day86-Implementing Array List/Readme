====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program of Array List Using Collection Frameworks

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using Collection Frameworks Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

*In Java, we use the ArrayList class to implement the functionality of resizable-arrays.
**It implements the List interface of the collections framework.
***The Java collections framework provides a set of interfaces and classes to implement various data structures and algorithms.
****The Collection interface is the root interface of the collections framework hierarchy.
*****Java does not provide direct implementations of the Collection interface but provides implementations of its subinterfaces like List, Set, and Queue

==>Java ArrayList Vs Array:
<1>In Java, we need to declare the size of an array before we can use it. Once the size of an array is declared, it's hard to change it.
<2>To handle this issue, we can use the ArrayList class. It allows us to create resizable arrays.
<3>Unlike arrays, arraylists can automatically adjust their capacity when we add or remove elements from them. Hence, arraylists are also known as dynamic arrays.

====>Explanation:
1>Firstly create a class And Inside the main method we need to create a collection for array
2>Now we need to add the elements in the list According to the code
3>Here In these program we have added languages called java,css,c++ Initially.
4>Then we have printed the list accordingly, Later we have changed the element from the array list
5>In the index-2 instead of c++ we have modified javascript language.
6>Similarly Then we have removed the css language from index-1.

====>Test Cases:
1>Follow the syntax appropriately 
ArrayList<String> languages = new ArrayList<>();

====>Sample Input And Output:

ArrayList: [Java, CSS, C++]
Modified ArrayList: [Java, CSS, JavaScript]
==========================================
Removing the CSS Language
Updated ArrayList: [Java, JavaScript]
Removed Element: CSS
============================================
