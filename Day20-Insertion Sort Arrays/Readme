==>Todays problem: Program to Sort elements in the array which is completely user based Insertion Sort.

==>Solution:

Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple logic using Arrays concept.
   
==>Explanation:
1>First we need enter the array size.
2>Then we need to enter the elements in the array.
3>Now variable i starts from 1 to n-1 
4>And temp value will be equals to array of i i.e(arr[i])
5>Then i-1 value will be stored in j
6>Now it checks the condition that temp should be Greater than arr[j] and j should be greater than -1
7>If the condition is true then arr[j+1] will be equals to arr[j]
8>And arr[j+1] equals to temp
9>Now we need to print array elements which are in sorted order.

==>Sample Input:
Enter the size of array:
5
Enter elements in the array
18
86
25
56
75

==>Output:
Sorted order:
18
25
56
75
86
