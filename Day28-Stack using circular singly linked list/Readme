==>Todays problem: Program to perform all operations like push pop and display using stack circular singly linked list

==>Solution:
Here this problem is simple and I have implemented with simple Circular Linked list Concept

==>Explanation:
1>Firstly we need to create a node then we need to create the push operation.
2>Now we need to take input from the user that to "enter the data" then if top is equal to null then top is equal to new_node and temp is equal to top
3>Otherwise new_node.next is equal to top then top is equal to new_node and temp.next is equal to top
4>Now we should create the pop operation inside that we need to check that top is equal to null 
5>If the condition is true then we should print stack is empty Otherwise top is equal to top.next
6>And top.next is equal to top. Then we need to create the display operation inside that we need check the condition that top is equal to null
7>If the condition is true then we should print stack is empty
8>Otherwise we need to print the temp.data, before that we need to check that temp is not equal to null and temp.next is not equal to null
9>Now inside the main method we need to take input from the user that to press 1 to push,press 2 to pop,press 3 to display And enter your choice
10>Then we need to use the switch case for implementing the push pop and display operations
11>Now At last we need to take input from the user that whether Enter 0 to go to main menu and to exit Succesfully.

==>Testcases:
The element shoud not be float type,string or double type
